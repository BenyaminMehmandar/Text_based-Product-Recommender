This repository showcases an exciting project leveraging the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model to enhance the online shopping experience. Our aim is to develop a robust NLP model that integrates with platforms like DigiKala to provide personalized product recommendations based on arbitrary natural language text input. By harnessing the power of BERT, users can receive highly relevant product suggestions tailored to their preferences, ultimately improving their shopping journey. Join us as we explore the capabilities of the BERT model in revolutionizing online product discovery and recommendation systems.
